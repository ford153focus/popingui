# popingui

## curses app for multiple async ping

Popingui.php is unfinished and deprecated, placed only for historical value for me. Use python's popingui.py instead of it.

### Install & Usage

Just download popingui.py and launch in terminal emulator or tty.

Targets configuring in targets.json

Exit from app is standard ^C (ctrl+c combination).
